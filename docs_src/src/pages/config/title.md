# Title option

There are two properties which can be changed:

* `title.main` - this is constant part of the page's title.

* `title.header` - if `true`, content of the first header on the page will be added before `title.main` in the page's title. It will look up for 1 and 2 level markdown or HTML headers on the current page.
