# Theming

Svelte-docs has very customizable appearance. All you need to change almost every visual aspect of your documentation is situated in `src/theme` dir.

### Themes

At the moment we have only one default theme which is made as a copy of the official [Svelte documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs) theme. But feel free to [add](https://github.com/alexxnb/svelte-docs/pulls) your own fantastic theme to our repository. 

### Colors

You can change colors of the current theme by changing custom properties in the `src/theme/styles.css` file.

### Styles

You can find all styles of the site in the `src/theme/styles` directory. 

### Layout

You can find Svelte components in the `src/theme/components` directory. It is barebone of the documentation site. Change it only if you know what you do.
