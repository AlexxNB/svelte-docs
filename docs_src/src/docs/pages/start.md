# Getting started

Just run this command in the directory of your project:

```bash
npm init svelte-docs
```

It will ask you about destination directory for the documents sources. Then it will download template and theme into the specified directory and install required NPM packages.

Then enter to the new directory and start documentation site on local machine:

```bash
cd docs_src
npm run dev
```

Point your browser on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and thats all.
