# Pathes option

There are two pathes you can change. 

* `pathes.dev` - directory, where builded site is stored in development mode when you run command `npm run dev`. It is nonoptimized version with additional code for debugging during development process. **Don't use this files in production!**

* `pathes.build` - directory, where stored files of the builded site for production when you run command `npm run build`. You can deploy these files to the any service, which is support serving of the static files.

> In most cases you don't need to change these options.
