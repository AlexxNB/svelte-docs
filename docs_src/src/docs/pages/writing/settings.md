# Pages configuration

You can configure every pages with few parameters in markdown's metatags block at the top of needed pages.

### fullscreen

By default all pages has a layout with left sidebar. But if you set the `fullscreen` option this way:

```markdown
---
fullscreen: true
---
... 
```

... page will render without sidebar.
