# Static files

Any static files used in documents such as images, icons or files for download are stored in `src/pages/static` directory.

For example, if you placed image in the `src/pages/static/great-success.png` then you can include it by following code:

```markdown
![Great Success](static/great-success.png);
```

... and get image on your page:

![Great Success](static/great-success.png);
